Checklist is an open source cross-platform task management application written with [Wails](https://wails.io/). Right now the project aims to be a Things3 clone and alternative, in a later stage of development checklist should get more of it's own identity.

Organize your tasks quick and neatly so you can focus on what matters.

## Mission

**Task managers should not be something you have to pay for**.  
The mission of Checklist is to create a high-quality, user-friendly application that **will always remain free for everyone**.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome and highly appreciated.
